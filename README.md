# OpenVPN-WebAdmin Version 0.1 -- Work in Progress
Manage OpenVPN configurations in a web browser

Only tested on Ubuntu Server 20.04 w/ LEMP stack.

This is functional code serving as a rough draft for the project. 

It is barebones and does not incorporate adequate security features for production use.
